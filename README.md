# cse382 - Mobile App Development

Provided projects I built within my Mobile App Development course, including my final project GradeBook. 

GradeBook is a tool for educators to track their courses and students in each course, input students assignment/quiz/exam grades within each course, control weighting element of grading, and view all relevant information within a visually stimulating and intuitive design.
